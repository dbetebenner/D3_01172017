New Year's Resolution for 2017: Make a D3 Block a day to teach myself D3. This is Number 17. This example
returns to [the USA district map](https://github.com/dbetebenner/D3_01102017) using an improved set of shape
files that highlight the states as well as the districts. The topoJSON files used to construct this visualization were created by me using
[shape files](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/geographicDistrictBoundary.aspx) compiled by the NCES and the United States Census Bureau.
[The Center for Assessment](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment) makes these
[state and national school district topoJSON files](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGPspatialData) available
for anyone to use in their own development.
